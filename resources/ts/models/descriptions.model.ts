    "PASTGROWTH": "To be successful and remain in business, both growth and profitability are important and necessary. Net Income growth is often seen as a sign of a company's efficiency from an operational standpoint, but is influenced heavily by a company's goals and challenges and should therefore be assessed in conjunction with other metrics like revenue and operating income growth.",
    "ROC": "Return on capital ratios give a sense of how well a company is using its capital (equity, assets, capital employed, etc.) to generate profits (operating income, net income, etc.). In simple words, these ratios show how much income is generated for each dollar of capital invested.",
    "MARGINS": "Profit margins represent what percentage of sales has turned into profits. Simply put, the percentage figure indicates how many cents of profit the company has generated for each dollar of sale." + "\n\n" + 
               "Profit margins help investors assess if a company's management is generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and overhead costs are being contained."
